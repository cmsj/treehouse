IMPORTANT: You must have MySQL installed to use Treehouse and if the header files are not in /usr/include/mysql then you will need to edit "configure.in". The same applies for the MySQL shared libraries

Treehouse is very easy to install because it uses the GNU autoconf and automake scripts, so, for most purposes, the following commands should work with no problems:

./autogen.sh   (use '--with-debug' to build a debugging version of Treehouse)
make
make install
cd dbase
./make_db.sh   (you must be the user that has admin privaleges on the MySQL server to do this)

(the final step will create the MySQL database)

By default, MySQL uses startup options that aren't optimal for use with an application such as Treehouse. We recommend passing the options:

  -O max_allowed_packet=50M
  -O key_buffer=512k
  -O sort_buffer=16k
  -O table_cache=32
  -O record_buffer=8k
  -O net_buffer=10K

to the MySQL binary when it is started (usually from an init script).

During the install, an entry in the GNOME "foot" menu will be created for Treehouse (in the 'Internet' section) - click on it to run Treehouse, or type 'treehouse' at a shell.
